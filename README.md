## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Problem Creater's Organization
The primary goal of this problem is to create a system that simulates a professional interview experience, addressing the following aspects:

Question Relevance: Questions posed to the candidates should be matched to their expertise area and the level of their intended position (entry-level, mid-level, or senior).

Candidate Responses Evaluation: The responses from candidates should be analyzed for relevancy and depth, ensuring that they are appropriate to the question asked.

Quantitative Scoring System: The solution should provide a score that quantifies the relevance of both the questions and the candidate's responses. These scores should contribute to an overall assessment of the candidate's suitability for the advertised post.

## Idea
Location Finder for Nearest E-Waste Facilities:

Interactive Map: The website could include an interactive map that shows users the nearest e-waste recycling centers based on their location.
Search Functionality: Users can input their zip code, city, or even device type to find the closest facility.
Facility Details: Clicking on a location would provide more information about the facility (e.g., operating hours, contact information, types of devices accepted, etc.).
Educational Pop-Ups / Info Boxes:

E-Waste Education: Short pop-ups that explain the components of e-waste, the dangers they pose to the environment (e.g., toxic chemicals like lead, mercury, cadmium), and their potential impact on human health.
Infographics: Quick visual aids to show how much e-waste is generated globally, the environmental benefits of recycling, and the timeline of e-waste breakdown.
Factoids: Display quick facts on harmful chemicals in devices, like the fact that an old CRT monitor can contain up to 4-8 pounds of lead.
Device Model Input for Credit Points:

Device Identification: Users could input the model of their old device (e.g., phone, laptop, tablet) to estimate the amount of precious metals (like gold, silver, copper) that can be recovered from it.
Credits for Recycling: For every device properly recycled, users would earn credits (points) based on the estimated value of recoverable materials. The credit system could be linked to rewards like:
Discounts on new devices.
Donations to environmental or e-waste-related charities.
Vouchers for eco-friendly products or services.
Tracking System: Users can create accounts to track their recycling history and accumulated points, motivating them to recycle more over time.
Partnerships with E-Waste Facilities:

The site could form partnerships with local e-waste collection and recycling centers, encouraging them to provide incentives, such as bonuses or extra points for certain types of devices or large quantities.
It could also include a rating system for users to review facilities based on their experiences (e.g., easy drop-off, customer service).
Sustainability Blog or News Feed:

A section to keep users updated on e-waste trends, innovations in recycling technologies, and global initiatives aimed at reducing e-waste.
Stories about companies that have developed circular economies for electronics or those with the best take-back programs.
