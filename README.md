SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Problem Creater's Organization
The primary goal of this problem is to create a system that simulates a professional interview experience, addressing the following aspects:

1.Question Relevance: Questions posed to the candidates should be matched to their expertise area and the level of their intended position (entry-level, mid-level, or senior).

2.Candidate Responses Evaluation: The responses from candidates should be analyzed for relevancy and depth, ensuring that they are appropriate to the question asked.

3.Quantitative Scoring System: The solution should provide a score that quantifies the relevance of both the questions and the candidate's responses. These scores should contribute to an overall assessment of the candidate's suitability for the advertised post.
